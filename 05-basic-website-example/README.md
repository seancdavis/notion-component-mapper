# Notion Components Basic Website Example

This is a basic website that reads the content output from `04-transform-data` and feeds it through the `_layout.ejs` template to create a basic site.

## Installation

Install the dependencies:

    npm install

## Usage

Build the site:

    npm run build

Then start the dev server:

    npm run serve

The server will run at localhost:3000.

Note that this is only building the pages alone. There is no index or listing page. You'll have to navigate directly to the URL you'd like to view. You can reference from built files in the `dist` directory.
